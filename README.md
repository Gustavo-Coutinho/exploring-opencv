# Exploring OpenCV for Python

This is an repository which I am using to track my progress in my exploration of the library OpenCV for Python.

To install OpenCV for Python on your machine, follow these steps:
1. Install Python:
##### Windows (from Windows Terminal)
```
winget install python
```
1.5 Now, close and reopen Windows Terminal

##### macOS
I do not own a Mac, so I suggest you look up "OpenCV Python macOS install" on the internet

##### Ubuntu
```
sudo apt update; sudo apt install python3
```

##### Arch Linux
```
sudo pacman -Sy python3
```

2. Then, run 'pip' to install OpenCV and Numpy
```
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

3. OpenCV should now be installed on your machine. Keep in mind that some parts of the code might not work in Linux and Mac because I am currently developing these scripts only on Windows 11.

### What is OpenCV?
Quoting OpenCV.org to describe what is OpenCV
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.
